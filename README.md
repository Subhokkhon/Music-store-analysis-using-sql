Music Store Data Analysis (SQL Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a digital music store database using SQL to answer a series of business-related questions. The dataset contains information about employees, customers, invoices, artists, albums, and tracks. By writing SQL queries, we extract meaningful insights that can help the store make data-driven decisions such as identifying top customers, popular music genres, and high-performing cities.

The analysis is divided into three difficulty levels: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced, each exploring deeper insights into the data.

✅ Question Sets & Insights
Set 1 – Easy

Senior-most employee based on job title.

Countries with the most invoices to identify major markets.

Top 3 invoice totals to analyze highest sales.

City with the best customers (highest revenue) – ideal for a promotional music festival.

Best customer – the person who spent the most money.

Set 2 – Moderate

List of Rock music listeners (email, name, and genre).

Top 10 Rock artists based on the number of tracks.

Tracks longer than average length, sorted by duration.

Set 3 – Advanced

Amount spent by each customer on artists – combining invoices, invoice lines, tracks, albums, and artists.

Most popular genre by country – identifies top-selling music styles per region.

Top customers per country – highest spenders in each country, including ties.
